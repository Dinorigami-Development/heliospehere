**Helioshere** ***- The Secret of The Maze*** is a multiplayer Hide N Seek game, where 2 teams will have to find the other one in turn in a maze. The maze features cool powers that the player can use whenever he wants.
At the beginning of the game, there is a grace period, and after that, a random team attacks the other one during a random amount of time, while the other one must hide. In the meantime, each player can collect items, earn EXP, have fun,.. To avoid camping, little ennemies (only visible on the map) will chase the nearest player and make him loose HP.
The player can unlock characters that have better starting stats by completing achievements and unique characters with secret achievements.
Of course, each player can upgrade his character during the game and try to max him.
Someone hosts a lobby and the others join it. While waiting, the players can choose which team they will belong too. The lobbies will accept 10 players maximum (5 vs 5), and the host will have the ability to check "fill with bots" in order to make the game playable, even alone or at 2.
